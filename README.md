## CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Quantifying Sources and Emission Levels   (Kaggal)
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022

About the dataset:\
This dataset provides an in-depth look into the global CO2 emissions at the country-level, allowing for a better understanding of how much each country contributes to the global cumulative human impact on climate. It contains information on total emissions as well as from coal, oil, gas, cement production and flaring, and other sources. The data also provides a breakdown of per capita CO2 emission per country - showing which countries are leading in pollution levels and identifying potential areas where reduction efforts should be concentrated. This dataset is essential for anyone who wants to get informed about their own environmental footprint or conduct research on international development trends.

Objective:
1.	Visualisations of the CO2 emission by country
2.	Top 10 countries that has highest CO2 emission 
3.	Using the per capita emissions data, track countries' progress in meeting carbon emission targets
4.	Analyse the correlation between different fossil fuel sources and CO2 emissions to understand how best to reduce CO2 emissions at a country-level
